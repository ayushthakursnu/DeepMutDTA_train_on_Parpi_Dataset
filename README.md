# Deep Contrastive Learning for High-Throughput Prediction of Drug Resistance Mutations from Sequences

**DeepMutDTA** is a novel label-aware contrastive learning framework that deciphers the impact of protein mutations on drug-target affinity (DTA). This repository provides a comprehensive implementation designed to predict DTA while addressing challenges related to mutation-induced variations. By integrating advanced sequence-based models with a specialized fine-tuning mechanism, DeepMutDTA achieves robust performance even when experimental data are limited.

---

## Overview

DeepMutDTA makes two significant contributions to the field of DTA prediction, particularly concerning protein mutations:

1. **Sequence-Based DTA Prediction:**  
   - **Protein and Drug Encoding:** Utilizes *FastFormer* for efficient processing of protein sequences and *MolFormer* for encoding drug SMILES.  
   - **Top-K Attention Mechanism:** Identifies key interactions between drugs and target proteins, which is critical for accurate affinity predictions, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

2. **Enhanced Mutation-Specific Prediction with SimSiam-MuTF:**  
   - **Label-Aware Contrastive Learning:** Implements a supervised SimSiam network combined with a task-specify (including regression and classification task) loss function to better capture mutation-specific features.  
   - **Robust Fine-Tuning:** Improves model performance on mutation-specific data even with minimal training samples by focusing on the differences induced by mutations.

## Pre-trained Models

To accelerate your experiments, pre-trained models are provided:

- **DeepMutDTA Pre-trained Model:**  
  Download the model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5F9cnOgDpu85VYhsgvAuVtCTcTw3UQu/view?usp=sharing).  
  Place the downloaded file in the `model` folder (or another directory of your choice) and update the file path on **line 23 of `main.py`** accordingly.

- **MolFormer Model:**  
  The MolFormer model is available from the [IBM MolFormer GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/molformer).  
  Download this model to your desired directory and modify the file paths on:  
  - **Lines 41 and 48 of `utils.py`**  
  - **Line 111 of `model.py`**

### 2. Training and Testing on Custom Data

If you wish to apply DeepMutDTA to your own datasets, please ensure your data is preprocessed into one of the following formats:

#### Regression Task Format

For regression tasks, format your data as follows:

| **seq_wt**      | **seq_mt**      | **smile**    | **label_wt**                         | **label_mt**                         |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| wt_protein_seq  | mt_protein_seq  | drug_smile   | -log( wt_affinity / 1e9 )             | -log( mt_affinity / 1e9 )             |

#### Classification Task Format

For classification tasks, format your data as follows:

| **seq_wt**      | **seq_mt**      | **smile**    | **label_wt** | **label_mt** |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| wt_protein_seq  | mt_protein_seq  | drug_smile   | 0            | 1            |
